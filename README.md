# VPN Connection Script for OpenVPN

Several scripts for connection to openvpn configs.  
Requirements
---------
     1. geoip
     2. openvpn 
     3. internet

Mainly for OpenVPN setups, in order to setup you need to make a directory: /usr/vpnconf or additionally edit the script to add to it.

You will also need to have a VPN otherwise this is pointless!
